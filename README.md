*This does not fully work*

## Building
This is done by running `make` in the src folder. Make accepts the following tasks which are defined:

 - `all` - this builds both the client and the server. It is the default task
 - `debug` - this builds both the client and the server for debugging purposes. (Removing optimizations)
 - `server` - this only builds the server
 - `client` - this only builds the client
 - `clean` - this removes any build files
